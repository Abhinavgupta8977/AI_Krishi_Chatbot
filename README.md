## Introduction

The AI Krishi Model is a web-based application powered by OpenAI's GPT-based model, specifically "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium". This model is designed to assist users with agriculture-related queries and provide information and suggestions on various agricultural topics.

The model is integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to interact with the AI through a chat interface. Users can input questions or statements related to agriculture, and the AI model will respond with informative and contextually relevant answers.

## Prerequisites

Before running the AI Krishi Model, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- OpenAI Python Library
- Transformers Library (for DialoGPT model)

You can install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install flask openai transformers
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Set up your OpenAI API key. Replace `"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"` with your actual OpenAI API key in the `chat` function.

4. Start the Flask application by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application should now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- Access the AI Krishi Model by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

- You'll see a chat interface where you can enter your questions or statements related to agriculture.

- The model will process your input and provide informative responses.

- You can interact with the AI in a conversation-like manner by entering multiple queries or statements.

- The model uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate responses and aims to provide helpful information related to agriculture.

## How It Works

- The web application is built using Flask, a Python web framework.

- The user interface allows you to input questions or statements.

- When you submit a query, it is sent to the `chat` function, which makes a call to OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate a response.

- The response is then displayed in the chat interface.

- The `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` model is used for this purpose and is fine-tuned for generating conversational responses.

- The application uses the OpenAI API to communicate with the model and retrieve responses.
